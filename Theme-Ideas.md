## Theme Ideas

**Tabbed layout for assignment pages** - use big colorful tabs like these:

* [W3schools: Tab Headers](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tab_header.asp)
* [HTML Dog: CSS Tabs](http://htmldog.com/techniques/tabs/)

So that it is easy to see at a glance where students are. Fix tabs to top of page, so they don't scroll off.

**Use _display_ and _summary_ tags to let students see the big picture and focus on individual tasks.**

**Add checkboxes for completed steps (to preserve context between classes).**

**Sticky Footer**
